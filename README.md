# Elliptical Omega App

A simply Shiny app to calculate the solid angle subtended by an ellipse. 
Uses the method from [John T. Conway 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2009.11.075).
Primerily built to help with designing of pinhole-plates for helium microscopes (SHeM's)
but could be used in other ways too.
